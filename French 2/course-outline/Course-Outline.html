<h2 class="text-left">Course Description</h1>
<p>
	This course integrates and extends previously introduced concepts of French 1. The course aims to develop competencies
	in French through authentic learning tasks in preparation for real-life application. Online activities will promote
	skill development in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in personal and professional contexts. You will use
	communication strategies to support interpersonal skills, to convey information, and to interact with various forms of
	persuasive exchanges in routine situations. You will develop skills for life-long learning that are transferable to
	employment. The targeted
	second language proficiency of the course aligns with level 3 requirements of the <a href="https://www.language.ca/ressourcesexpertise/niveaux-de-competence-linguistique-canadiens/">Canadian Language Benchmarks for
	French</a>, the NCLC.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="text-left">Eligibility for Prior Learning Assessment & Recognition (PLAR)</h2>
<p>
	Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) is a process a student can use to gain college credit(s) for learning
	and skills acquired through previous life and work experiences. Candidates who successfully demonstrate mastery of the
	course competency(ies) may be granted a “pass” for the course. The type of assessment method (s) used will be determined
	by subject matter experts. Because this is a pass/fail course, the PLAR will be assessed on this basis.
</p>

<p>
	<b>PLAR Eligibility</b>   Yes ☒ No ☐
</p>
<p>
	<b>PLAR Assessment (if eligible):</b>
</p>

<p>
	The PLAR will consist of an assessment that is similar to the final summative assessment for the course. Only one
	attempt will be permitted. If the PLAR is unsuccessful, the student will need to register for and successfully complete
	the full course in order to earn a pass.

<h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>

<p>
	Formative feedback will be provided through online activities and by the facilitator on selected activities.
	Formative
	feedback will not be graded and is meant to guide the learning process. In addition to formative feedback, the
	facilitator will observe demonstration of module development indicators on an integrated group of tasks more
	formally
	towards the end of the module through a formative assessment. A goal of the formative assessment is to prepare
	students
	for the summative assessment, and observations based on evaluation criteria will be recorded on a rubric that will
	also
	be used for the summative assessment; there is only one submission for the formative assessment, which is mandatory.
	Neither the formative feedback nor the formative assessment will factor into the final course pass/fail
	outcome but will instead help the student monitor their learning progress through the course.
</p>

<p>
	As a competency-based course, the course’s overall pass/fail assessment will be based solely on the three module
	summative assessments of integrated groups of authentic tasks, which the student will be
	required to complete to demonstrate their mastery of the course competency. A passing grade is set at 70%. If a pass
	is
	not earned the first time the student attempts the a module assessment, a second attempt will be permitted. If the
	second attempt is not successful, the student will be required to re-take the course in its entirety at the
	student’s cost.
</p>

<div class="lightbg red-lb">
	<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-10 offset-md-1">
		<h3>Important Note:</h3>
		<p>
			The final summative assessment must be successfully completed by the course end date. No extensions to this
			date will be
			provided unless accompanied in advance by an approved accommodation form. Therefore, students are strongly
			encouraged to
			attempt this final assessment at least two weeks prior to the course end date, in order to ensure sufficient
			time is
			available if a second attempt is required.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Your final course grade will be reported as a letter grade. After all three module summative assessments receive a
	pass
	for demonstrating competency of the development indicators, scores from the three module rubrics will be weighted
	and
	converted to a letter grade.
