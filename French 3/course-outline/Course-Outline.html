<h2 class="text-left">Course Description</h1>
<p>
	The progressive acquisition, reinforcement, and creative use of language structures will increase the student confidence
	to self-expression. With a strong focus on using the language to communicate in real-life scenarios, this course enables
	students to participate in simple conversations, make requests, suggestions or short presentations and express their
	opinion about present and past events. Tasks from both personal and professional settings will be used as formative and
	summative assessments.

<h2>General Course Outline Notes</h2>

<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Students should use the course outline as a learning tool to guide their achievement of the competency for this course.
		Specific questions should be directed to their individual facilitator.</li>
		<li>The college considers the electronic communication methods (i.e. MyCampus, DC Mail or DC Connect) as the primary channel
		of communication. Students are responsible to check these sources frequently for current course information.</li>
		<li>Facilitators are responsible for following this outline and facilitating the learning as detailed in this outline.</li>
		<li>Course outlines should be retained for future needs (i.e. university credits, transfer of credits etc.)</li>
		<li>A full description of the Academic Appeals Process can be found 
		<a href="https://durhamcollege.ca/wp-content/uploads/111-grade-appeals.pdf">here</a>.</li>
		<li>Faculty are committed to ensuring accessible learning for all students. Students who would like assistance with academic
		access and accommodations in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights Code should register with the Access and Support
		Centre (ASC). ASC is located in room SW116, Oshawa Campus and in room 180 at the Whitby Campus. Contact ASC at

		textual similarity to Turnitin.com. Further information about Turnitin can be found on the Turnitin.com website.</li>		
	</ol>
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Evaluation Process</h2>

<p>
	In order to assess progress throughout the course, the student will need to complete three formative assessments. These
	will not factor into the final course pass/fail outcome, but will instead help the student monitor their learning
	progress through the course. Any formative assessment that does not earn a “successfully completed” status will need to
	be repeated until that status has been achieved. A student cannot progress to the next portion of a course until the
	formative assessment(s) in the previous section have been successfully completed.
</p>

<p>
	As a competency-based course, the course’s overall pass/fail assessment will be based solely upon three summative
	authentic assessments (typically an integrated group of tasks), which the student will be required to complete to
	demonstrate their mastery of the course competency. If a pass is not earned the first time the student attempts the
	assessment, a second attempt will be permitted. If the second attempt is not successful, the student will be required to
	re-take the course in its entirety and at the student’s cost.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Important Note:</b> 
	The final summative assessment must be successfully completed by the course end date. No extensions to
	this date will be provided unless accompanied in advance by an approved accommodation form. Therefore, students are
	strongly encouraged to attempt this final assessment at least two weeks prior to the course end date, in order to ensure
	sufficient time is available if a second attempt is required.
